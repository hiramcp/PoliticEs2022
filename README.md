## Paper: Low-dimensional Stacking Model for Political Ideology Profiling
This manuscript describes the low-dimensional stacking model approach used to profile users to solve gender and profession identification and binary and multiclass ideology prediction tasks. We developed these models in the scope of the PoliticEs: Spanish Author Profiling for Political Ideology carried out at IberLEF@SEPLN 2022. Our methodology stacks several low-dimensional representations that can be used to visualize the dataset and as the input dataset for a classifier. While the results were late in the challenge, our final evaluations achieved high performances in the training and test partitions, and we believe that they are promising approaches in the road to create both transparent and competitive user profiling models.
